# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code?

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Fetch failed!");
    response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer

The issue with this code is that the `response.json();` on line 13 is not being returned, this means that the JSON data is not being console logged on line 15. `async/await` helps us avoid this mistake because we can add await infront of our fetch and an await infront of the response.json. This means that first we will wait for the data to get fetched from the api and then we will wait for that data to get parsed into JSON.
